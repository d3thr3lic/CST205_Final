Basement Scene:
You make your way down the half-rotted, creaky stairs leading to the basement.  The pale moonlight penetrating the weathered and streaked ground-level
windows provides just enough light for you identify your surroundings and effictively navigate through the labyrithe cellar room.  If only those windows 
were a little larger than size of a pet door, you could claim your freedom, you think to yourself.  In any case, you get to the end of the maze-like room,
and see a large steel-enforced door with 6 two-inch diameter rods securing the door to the granite wall. 

As you look around the room to uncover any clues to unlocking this behemoth of a barrier, you realize there are electric panels on each side of the walls
behind you.  The two walls have three panels each, and what appears to be a slot for a card of some sort to be inserted.  Two of the panels already have
a keycard already inserted.  One has a label of a Jack of Spades in the right most panel on one wall, and one has just an unlabeled keycard in the right-most panel
on the opposite wall.

A moonbeam through a window illuminates a dusty crumpled piece of paper in the corner of one of the walls. 

<action> read paper
    The note reads: "Hey <user name input>, Murry told me that these bastards rewired the circuit to the transport door, so the fuses need to go in the right order for it to open.  
    I can't remember the whole configuration, but the Ace goes on the same wall with the Jack, the Joker and King are definitely not next to each other, and the Joker 
    and Ace are opposite of each other on the walls."


ENDGAME
Win conditions = make correct configuration in <= 3 attempts (each failed attempt can play unnerving sounds as the enemy or enemies are getting closer)
(Add cool sound effect of the steel door being unlocked and rods moving; sliding heavy metal sounds)

You rush through the opening to a lit path ahead, running almost uncontrollably, never even thinking of looking back, and can taste imminent freedom and relief as you reach the end of the tunnel,
which leads you up a staircase and into the nearby Starbuck's storeroom right down the street from your house!  

Lose conditon = any attemps > 3 (blood curdling scream sound effects of player and of maniacal laughter by the enemy)
