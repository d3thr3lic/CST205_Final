You wake up in a dark, unfamiliar room that smells of old cedar and stale air. You feel a slight pain and notice there's a bruise and some dried
blood on the back of your head.  Behind the couch, you spot a backpack on the ground and promptly pick it up, but there's nothing inside.

Your mind is still hazy and you struggle to piece together what crazy events must have transpired that have now placed you in your current
situation.

Perhaps you fell... perhaps somebody knocked you out and left you in this strange room for some sinister purpose.. with no real answers and a 
growing sense of dread and urgency, you strap on the backpack in case it might be of some use, and look around the room, deciding on your next
move....
