A door suddenly opens and you walk through it. You make your way down the half-rotted, creaky stairs leading to the basement. 

The pale moonlight penetrating the weathered and streaked ground-level windows provides just enough light for you to identify your surroundings and effectively navigate through the labyrinth cellar room. 

If only those windows were a little larger than the size of a pet door, you could claim your freedom, you think to yourself. 

In any case, you get to the end of the maze-like room, and see a large steel-enforced door with 6 two-inch diameter rods securing the door to the granite wall.

As you look around the room to uncover any clues to unlocking this behemoth of a barrier, you realize there are electric panels on each side of the walls behind you. 

The two walls have three panels each, and what appears to be a slot for a card of some sort to be inserted. 

Two of the panels already have a keycard already inserted. 

One has a label of a Jack of Spades in the right-most panel on one wall, and one has just an unlabeled keycard in the right-most panel on the opposite wall.
